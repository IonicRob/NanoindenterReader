%% NanoMachineImport
% By Robert J Scales
% The objective of this code is to choose which machine the data you want
% to import is from. If it is produced from the Aglient software (e.g. XP
% or G200) then no changes will be made. However, if it is from another
% known machine it will convert it into a spreadsheet file of the correct
% format for NanaoDataCreater.
